# ChatMan
This is my group chat app, built with Node.js, Express, JavaScript, HTML, Tailwind CSS, and MySQL, enables users to create groups, add members, assign admins, and exchange messages and multimedia within the groups. The app provides a seamless communication experience while leveraging a robust backend with MySQL for data storage.
